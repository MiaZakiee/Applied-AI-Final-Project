Google Play Store App Analysis
📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes Google Play Store apps to uncover patterns and trends that influence app ratings. By leveraging a dataset of app features such as size, number of installs, reviews, and pricing, we aim to develop a predictive model for app ratings. This can provide insights for app developers and marketers to optimize their offerings for better user satisfaction and engagement.

🛠️ Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data to handle inconsistencies, missing values, and non-numeric entries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between app features and their ratings.
Predictive Modeling: Building a linear regression model to predict app ratings based on:
Number of reviews
App size
Number of installs
Price
Insights: Identifying key factors that contribute to high ratings for apps.
📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following key fields:

App: The name of the application.
Category: The category under which the app is listed (e.g., "Games," "Education").
Rating: The average user rating of the app (target variable for prediction).
Reviews: The total number of user reviews.
Size: The size of the app (e.g., "19M," "Varies with device").
Installs: The number of times the app has been installed (e.g., "10,000+").
Type: Whether the app is Free or Paid.
Price: The cost of the app (if Paid).
Content Rating: Age group for which the app is targeted (e.g., "Everyone," "Teen").
Genres: Genres associated with the app.
Last Updated, Current Ver, Android Ver: App versioning and compatibility metadata.
